##  Ansh Mishra

Hey, I am Ansh, MS20112. I hereby nominate myself for the post of co-convener for the Turing Club. I am a compititive programmer myself, hence would try to take this club to a level where we can start participating and winning prestigious competitions like GSoC, ACM-ICPC, Google Code Jam, Hash Code, etc. I have spilled the beans on my futher plans in my manifesto video.

## Sachin G Iyer

Hi, I am Sachin (MS20056). As a captain, I had to set up my school's first serious cricket team without the support of the administration (who gave us a volleyball coach and no practice.) Unfortunately, this is the same skillset I will need for this club.
